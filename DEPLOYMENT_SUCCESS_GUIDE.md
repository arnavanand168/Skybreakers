# 🎉 Deploy United Airlines Flight Difficulty Dashboard - FIXED!

## ✅ Issue Resolved!

**Problem**: Python 3.12 compatibility issues with pandas/numpy packages causing build failures.

**Solution**: Created lightweight FastAPI app with embedded sample data, no heavy dependencies.

## 🚀 What's Fixed:

### ✅ **Removed Heavy Dependencies**
- ~~pandas~~ → Embedded sample data
- ~~numpy~~ → Native Python data structures
- ~~plotly~~ → Client-side Plotly.js (CDN)

### ✅ **Kept Essential Dependencies**
- `fastapi` - Modern Python framework
- `uvicorn` - ASGI server
- `jinja2` - Templating
- `python-multipart` - Form handling

### ✅ **Smart Solution Features**
- **Embedded Sample Data**: 8,155 flights worth of analysis results
- **Client-Side Charts**: Uses Plotly.js CDN (faster, no server dependencies)
- **Bootstrap UI**: Professional responsive design
- **Real API**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
