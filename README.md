## How to Run the Analysis

### Prerequisites
- SQLite3 installed on your system
- All CSV data files in the same directory

### Running the Complete Analysis
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/skyhack

# Run the complete analysis
sqlite3 skyhack.db < complete_analysis.sql
```

### Individual Phase Execution
If you prefer to run phases separately:

```bash
# Phase 1: Database setup and data import
sqlite3 skyhack.db < setup_database.sql

# Phase 2: Data aggregation
sqlite3 skyhack.db < aggregate_data.sql

# Phase 3: Master table construction
sqlite3 skyhack.db < build_master_table.sql

# Phase 4: EDA and feature engineering
sqlite3 skyhack.db < eda_and_features.sql

# Phase 5: Score development
sqlite3 skyhack.db < score_development.sql

# Phase 6: Insights analysis
sqlite3 skyhack.db < insights_analysis.sql

# Phase 7: Export results
sqlite3 skyhack.db < export_results.sql
```

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Foundation and Consolidation
- Imported 5 CSV files into SQLite database
- Created proper indexes for performance
- Established relationships between tables

### Phase 2: Data Aggregation
- **Bag Summary**: Aggregated bag data by flight (total bags, transfer bags, transfer ratio)
- **Passenger Summary**: Aggregated passenger data by flight (total passengers, children, special needs)
- **Special Needs Summary**: Joined passenger and remark data to identify special service requests

### Phase 3: Master Table Construction
- Created comprehensive master table joining all aggregated data
- Added international flight identification
- Calculated delay metrics and ground time pressure

### Phase 4: Feature Engineering
Created key difficulty drivers:
- **Load Factor**: Percentage of seats filled
- **Ground Time Pressure**: Ratio of scheduled vs. minimum required ground time
- **Transfer Bag Ratio**: Proportion of bags that are transfers
- **SSR Intensity**: Proportion of passengers with special service requests
- **International Flag**: Binary indicator for international flights
- **Fleet Complexity**: Aircraft type complexity (1-3 scale)
- **Time Complexity**: Departure time complexity (1-3 scale)

### Phase 5: Score Development and Normalization
- Applied Min-Max normalization to all features (0-1 scale)
- Implemented weighted scoring system:
  - Ground Time Pressure: 25%
  - Load Factor: 20%
  - Transfer Bag Ratio: 20%
  - SSR Intensity: 15%
  - International: 10%
  - Fleet Complexity: 5%
  - Time Complexity: 5%

### Phase 6: Classification and Ranking
- Ranked flights by difficulty score within each day
- Classified flights into three categories:
  - **Difficult**: Top 20% of daily flights
  - **Medium**: Next 30% of daily flights
  - **Easy**: Bottom 50% of daily flights

## Key Findings

### Classification Results
- **Total Flights Analyzed**: 8,155
- **Difficult Flights**: 1,624 (19.91%)
- **Medium Flights**: 2,449 (30.03%)
- **Easy Flights**: 4,082 (50.06%)

### Top Difficult Destinations
1. **YYZ (Toronto)**: 77 difficult flights (4.74% of all difficult flights)
2. **STL (St. Louis)**: 53 difficult flights (3.26%)
3. **LHR (London Heathrow)**: 44 difficult flights (2.71%)
4. **YOW (Ottawa)**: 41 difficult flights (2.52%)
5. **YUL (Montreal)**: 39 difficult flights (2.40%)

### Fleet Type Analysis
- **B767-300**: 98.33% difficult flights
- **B787-8**: 97.33% difficult flights
- **B787-10**: 93.79% difficult flights
- **B757-200**: 42.86% difficult flights

### Time of Day Analysis
- **Evening (16-19)**: 31.6% difficult flights
- **Night (20-23)**: 25.85% difficult flights
- **Early Morning (5-7)**: 16.4% difficult flights
- **Morning (8-11)**: 15.48% difficult flights
- **Afternoon (12-15)**: 10.46% difficult flights

## Business Recommendations

### 1. Resource Allocation Optimization
- **Priority 1**: Allocate additional ground crew and equipment to flights classified as "Difficult"
- **Focus Areas**: International destinations (YYZ, LHR, YOW, YUL) and wide-body aircraft (B767, B787)

### 2. Operational Timing Adjustments
- **Evening Rush**: Implement enhanced staffing during 16:00-19:00 timeframe
- **International Flights**: Consider extended ground time buffers for international operations
- **Wide-body Aircraft**: Increase minimum turn times for B767 and B787 fleets

### 3. Special Service Management
- **Proactive Planning**: Identify flights with high SSR intensity and prepare specialized resources
- **Staff Training**: Enhance crew training for handling multiple special service requests simultaneously

### 4. Baggage Operations
- **Transfer Bag Optimization**: Implement dedicated transfer bag handling for flights with high transfer ratios
- **Technology Integration**: Deploy automated bag tracking systems for complex transfer operations

## Technical Notes

### Data Quality
- All flights successfully processed and classified
- No missing critical data points
- Ground time pressure calculations handle edge cases (minimum turn time = 0)

### Performance
- SQLite database optimized with proper indexes
- Complete analysis runs in under 2 minutes on standard hardware
- Memory efficient processing of 687K+ bag records and 687K+ passenger records

### Scalability
- System designed to handle larger datasets
- Modular SQL scripts allow for easy maintenance and updates
- Normalization approach ensures consistent scoring across different time periods

## Output Files
- **test_arnav.csv**: Complete flight analysis results with all features and classifications
- **skyhack.db**: SQLite database with all intermediate tables and final results
- **complete_analysis.sql**: Single script to reproduce entire analysis
